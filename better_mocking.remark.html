# A safer way to mock
### using realistic test doubles

- Hi everyone, I am Tim, and I work on the Core Services team at livingsocial
- yes, we are hiring, and it is a *awesome* place to work

### Motivation

* SOA apps have dependencies

* VCR cassettes are big and become stale

* Generally mocks cumbersome & only a snapshot in time

???
* We maintain a large number of inter-dependent apps and services
  * we develop the services, client-applications *and* service access gems
  * how do you test them all in isolation?

* We use VCR for short-circuiting some of the calls to dependencies
  * but who here really likes committing, and maintaining, all those cassettes in their repo?
  * also, VCR cassettes are only good if you refresh them regularly, and finding the right frequency for that is hard

* Using tools like mocha, RSpec mocks results in lots of set-up code
  * that code is both cumbersome and boring
  * also, if your backend API or behavior changes, your tests won't notice
---

### Built-in, realistic mocks

* test doubles for test speed

* deliver realistic samples with the client gem

* evolve samples in lock-step with API

???

Faced with that, our team at LivingSocial started using a new approach

* We still use test doubles to not compromise on test suite runtimes

* But: we are also the maintainers of our client gems
  * we are in the position to add realistic sample objects to the gems that expose the service APIs

* We evolve our mocks (meant to be used by client apps in their tests) in lock-step with our service APIs

---

### Pluggable backends

* Two backends
  * 'real' one for actual service calls
  * short-circuited 'mock' one for tests
  * both fulfill the same contract

* Gem's main API-exposing code
  * has `backend` accessors (`attr_writer: backend`)
  * only calls methods on current backend defined in 'abstract' contract


???
In our approach we use 'pluggable backends' in our services

We implement two backends in our client gems:
* one that actually makes HTTP calls to reach out to the backend service that exposes an API
* and another 'mock backend' that makes no such calls
  * this one short-circuits the calls and instead serves data out of an in-memory cache

Key is that both (fake and real) backends expose the exact same interface
* The layer of the gem that exposes the actual API has methods to inject one of these two backends
* That main API-exposing layer *only* calls backend methods that are part of this contract

---

### Realistic canned responses

* mock backend serves the same result objects

* pre-loaded realistic 'fakes'

???

* The mock backend serves objects with same API as the objects returned by 'real' backend
  * they actual instances of the same model classes that are returned by real backend

* We also make sure that, when the mock backend is used, it comes pre-loaded with realistic 'fakes'
  * In our example, we have a service that serves 'market' or city information
  * when the `LS::Cities` gem is switched to 'mock backend', it serves objects for a range of well known markets

---

### Running tests in mock mode

* Ease of test set-up
  ````ruby
  LS::Cities.mock_mode!

  ````
* Customizing mocks
  ````ruby
  # add a couple of cities to the mock mode's backend data
  my_test_cities = [
      LS::Cities::TestMocks.custom_city(id: 42, display_name: 'My City', ...),
      LS::Cities::TestMocks.custom_city(id: 43, display_name: 'Your City', ...)
  ]
  
  LS::Cities.backend.add_cities(*my_test_cities)
  ````

???

* The goal was to make it as easy as possible for the client apps to use the mocks
  * applications under test place the service client library into ‘mock mode’
  * this one line configures it to serve responses entirely out of the mock backend’s registry of pre-loaded response objects


* In case there are special test needs that aren't covered by those canned responses
  * ... the apps under test can customize the mocks
  * the client library allows for creating / adding / removing additional mock objects to / from the mock backend’s business object registry

---
class: middle
### Why use this approach?

* still use mocks
  * fast
  * no 'repo pollution'

* confidence in test suite

* less ceremony

* realistic 'fakes'
???
So, what's the point for us?

* We still have fast tests
* We reduce 'repo pollution' with VCR cassettes
* We increase the level of confidence in our test suites
  * by using mock objects to evolve in lock-step with the client library version

* We have less boring, boilerplate code (to write and maintain) to set-up mocks and expectations

* The client apps work with realistic 'fakes' that behave exactly like the real things

- This pretty much all I wanted to mention for today
- Here are some references for this talk
    - first is livingsocial engineering's tech blog
      - you'll find a much more detailed post on this topic, showing code about our approach
    - the next two links are great general references on the topic of test doubles
      - the first one is a link to the pattern definition on Xunit Patterns
      - the second one is a really good article by Martin Fowler on the topic
    - and finally you can find this presentation on my GH pages
      - it's a "Remark.js" (= HTML with markdown) presentation,so you can hit "p" to see the presenter notes
