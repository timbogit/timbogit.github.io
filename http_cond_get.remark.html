# HTTP Conditional GET and you
## Making your server work less

tim.schmelmer@livingsocial.com
???
- Hi everyone, I am Tim, and I work on the Consumer Shared Services team
- We build a lot of services there, and whenever I talk to people I find that
  many don't realize how cool HTTP is, especially about built-in caching support
- I hope you'll try some of this out with your own APIs

### If-Modified-Since / Last-Modified
````
    Client    <----------------------------->    Server
 1.    -               GET /deals/1.json           ->
 2.   <-      Last-Modified: Mon, 11 Aug 2014 ...   -
...
 3.    -     If-Modified-Since: Mon, 11 Aug 2014   ->
 4.   <-          HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified         -
````
???
- HTTP supports several headers to help with caching
- Some of those headers are client-side only, while others are server-only
- This slide shows how the If-Modified-Since / Last-Modified pair
- In the example, the client (left) makes its first request for deal 1 as JSON, not sending *any* such headers
- The server responds with the data, and includes a *response* header with the last modification date for the data
- The client now can store that date/time and add it as a If-Modified-Since *request* header
- If nothing has changed since the requested modification time, then the server can respond with a simple 304
  - no JSON re-serialization by the client needed, nor response reserialization on the server side

### If-None-Match / ETag
````
    Client    <----------------------------->    Server
 1.    -               GET /deals/1.json           ->
 2.   <-             ETag: "3e86-410-3596fbbc"      -
...
 3.    -     If-None-Match: "3e86-410-3596fbbc"    ->
 4.   <-          HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified         -
````
???
- Another such header pair is ETag and If-None-Match
- In this example, the client first makes a request without sending any related headers
- The server responds with the data and a *response* header with a unique Entity Tag for the data, calculated server-side
- The client now adds the tag it last received as the If-None-Match *request* header ...
- and if the server finds that the requested entity's tag hasn't changed compared to the tag sent by the client, it can respond with
  an empty-body 304 response

### `Cache-Control` header
- `private`: shared caches / proxy cannot cache
- `no-cache`: caches need to re-submit request to origin server
- `public`: responses is cacheable
- `max-age=[secs]`: max. time in secs a result is fresh
???
- Cache-Control is a *response* header a server can use to control all caching entities (from proxies to
  browsers or other consuming end-clients) along the request/response chain
- there are a lot of cache directives that can be included (and combined) in this header, but here are some
  important ones we are using:
  - `private`: browsers and client-side caches can store the response; shared (intermediate) caches & proxies cannot.
  - `no-cache`: this forces caches to re-submit the request to origin server before releasing a cached copy; this useful to assure authentication.
  - `public`: marks responses as cacheable (as `private` is the default).
  - `max-age=[secs]`: indicated the maximum time in seconds the result is considered fresh, relative to the time of the request

### Using curl to try this out
````
$ curl -I "inventory-service-development.herokuapp.com/api/v1/inventory_items/321.json"

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: max-age=300, public
...
Etag: "83c6c96f5042be326fce63a3e1fa0c9e"
Last-Modified: Sun, 20 Apr 2014 05:40:29 GMT
````
````
$ curl -I -H 'If-Modified-Since: Sun, 26 Apr 2014 05:40:29 GMT' "http://..."

HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
...
Last-Modified: Sun, 20 Apr 2014 05:40:29 GMT
````
````
$ curl -I -H 'If-None-Match: "83c6c96f5042be326fce63a3e1fa0c9e"' "http://..."

HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
...
Etag: "83c6c96f5042be326fce63a3e1fa0c9e"
````
???
- Here are some `curl` commands to an actual (toy) service we spun up that implement HTTP Conditional GET
- the first request simply requests a resource, without adding any headers
  - the service responds with the pertinent `Etag` and `Last-Modified` headers.
- The next two statements now include the correct `If-Modified-Since` and `If-None-Match` headers respectively ...
  - ... so the server can just respond with a 304 response.

### Browsers versus API clients

Browsers insert Headers
![PastedGraphic-1.png](https://draftin.com:443/images/15467?token=I8c6GdaBXKVEjBrla5t5p6QZ307hT47YqB9EzdV4k8brPdYTZTJ-7OT_veTPn51sZNabE_OyzQ5rJIZLoKAV5D0)

Your usual API client won't / can't
???
- One thing to be aware of with regards to using browsers to test a JSON API:
   - browsers automatically keep state and cache, so that they can insert those appropriate cache headers in the next request
- Most of the API client implementations we are using do *not* honor the cache-control or conditional get headers ...
  - ... as it usually is a little harder for web apps to keep state and invalidate such keep such state.

### [Varnish](https://www.varnish-cache.org/about) to the rescue
![varnish-diagram-570x158.png](https://draftin.com:443/images/15468?token=VssfTBjIoN-ED2HSMgVxNiUPUZM7pmDvKLtUkXYHf8H73n7uesLoSPCFaAjBVBNoW6llDW5YfJ26G3gjayRfaXI)
* respects `Cache-Control` headers
* can insert `If-Modified-Since` / `If-None-Match`
* grace mode: uses cached object with expired TTL
* vrooom!
???
- This is where a reverse proxy (like varnish) comes in handy
- Varnish is a caching proxy that sits between your clients and your service
- It respects `Cache-Control` headers, caching only what the service tells it to cache
- Varnish can be configured to insert the `If-Modified-Since` / `If-None-Match` request headers if API the clients do not
- Another nice feature is grace mode:
    * when in that mode, it uses a cached object even if their TimeToLive has expired
    * this means it can deliver old content while fetching the latest content from the backend server
    * it can also help uptime, as it can continue to serve stale data while no healthy backend is available
- varnish also is blazing fast, as it is effectively just constrained by the speed of the network

### How to use this in your Rails app / service (1/2)
````ruby
class InventoryItemsController < ApplicationController
  ...
  # Show a single inventory_item
  def show
    render_if_stale(@item,last_modified: @item.updated_at.utc,etag: @item) do |presenter|
      presenter.hash
    end
    # explicitly set the Cache-Control header to public and max-age,
    # making the response cacheable for varnish
    expires_in caching_time, public: true
  end
end
````
???
- And finally, here is some Ruby code that implements HTTP Conditional GET
- The controller action uses a small helper (which will see on the next slide)
  to only serialize and render JSON for the requested object if the item is 'stale'
- staleness is determined by any `If-None-Match` or `If-Modified-Since` headers the
  client (or varnish) might be sending
- The last line sets the correct cache control header, making it public, with a max-age of 5 minutes

### How to use this in your Rails app / service (2/2)
````ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    ...
    def caching_time
      5.minutes
    end

    def not_found_with_max_age(max_age = caching_time)
      head :not_found
      expires_in max_age, public: true
    end

    # Renders the results of a block passed in as JSON, but only if the
    # given 'staleness' critera are met.
    # ...
    # stale_criteria - the argument to pass on to Rails'
    #                  `stale?` helper to determine freshness
    # ...
    def render_if_stale(entities, stale_criteria = nil, &blk)
      return if !stale_criteria.nil? && !stale?(stale_criteria)

      entity_array = Array(entities)
      presenter_class = find_presenter(entity_array, params[:version])
      return not_found_with_max_age(caching_time) unless presenter_class

      render_presenter(entities, presenter_class, &blk)
    end
end
````
???
- this is the common helper code used in all the controller actions of the service
- first is the common caching time (5 minutes)
- next is a helper to tell a client that the info wasn't found, and not to ask again for the next 5 minutes
- lastly, the implementation of the `render_if_stale` helper
  - as you can see, it asserts that the 'stale' criteria passed in are indeed met
  - if the data is fresh, then Rails's `stale?` helper will actually set the response code to 304 automatically under the hood
  - the actual presenter finding and object serialization code will only be executed in case the data is stale

- This pretty much all I wanted to mention for today
- There are some great references out there on the web for this topic
  - the first one is a good overview of this topic, more in-depth around the actual protocol behind this
  - Wikipedia's entry about ETags is a very useful read, as well
  - albeit a little dated, the "Advanced Caching in Rails" guide is very in-depth and offers lots of practical
    advice
  - and lastly, the bit.ly URL points you to my drop-box share which holds this HTML/MarkDown presentation
