# Documenting and exploring your APIs
## using swagger specs, `swagger_yard` and swagger UI

- Hi everyone, I am Tim, and I work on the Consumer Shared Services team
- As the team name denotes, we are building and maintaining a set of services there, and we have recently started to try and adopt
a common way of describing, documenting, and testing our RESTful APIs with a set of tools
- This talk will give you a conceptual overview of these tools and show off some of the hings they bring to the table
---
class: middle
### Motivation

* Why document, it's just RESTful?

* explore your API

* machine readable / cross-language

???
* So *why on earth* document a RESTful API?
  * RESTful, it doesn't really say much in detail.
  * What HTTP Status (success and error) codes will you use for which situations
  * `204` or `200` response codes for successful `POST`s/`PUT`s?
  * which `4xx` code range of messages do you support, and will there be additional error messaging?
  * where does authentication / authorization go: into the header, in a URL parameter, ...?
  * What about versioning information? Where will it go?

* Explorer is hte killer feature

* Swagger can serve as general, cross-platform IDL

### The parts
* swagger-spec
  * {show JSON here}

* swagger_yard
  * {show swagger_yard comment here}

* swagger_ui
  * {show an image of the explorer here}
???


- swagger-spec:
     - explain what this does / is
- swagger-yard:
     - explain
- swagger_ui:
     - more blah

### Demo time
* [docs for an API and operations](http://code.livingsocial.net/tschmelmer/consumer-service/blob/master/app/controllers/locations_controller.rb)

* [docs for model](http://code.livingsocial.net/tschmelmer/consumer-service/blob/master/app/models/location.rb)

* [swagger UI on myQA](http://consumer-service.consumer-shared-services.qa.livingsocial.net/swagger/doc#!/locations)
  * point out sections in UI just defined
  * show raw JSON specs
  * play with API endpoints
???


- Operation docs:
     - show the various sections of the API definitions
- Model Docs:
     - show the various sections of the model definitions
- swagger UI:
  - point out sections in UI just defined
  - show raw JSON specs
  - play with API endpoints

### Final thoughts
* Feedback while designing

* Please play and contribute!

* Next steps
  * integrating with techops-web
  * experiment with on-the-fly client generation


???

- design feedback:
     - get feedback before implementing your API
     - quick iteration on showing updates
- play and contribute:
     - we always find new stuff we need
     - tony.pitale@ or tim.schmelmer@ are more than happy to help
- next steps:
  - would like to get away from having to host swagger UI in every project
    - instead have a single swagger Explorer somewhere in techops-web and just point it at the different API specs
  - adam.keys@ is experimenting with a way to consume the API JSON specs from a given URL and then auto-generate Ruby objects that expose the APIs defined there
    - potential to get out of the game of maintaining client gem projects for each service
