- This pretty much all I wanted to mention for today
- Here are some references for this talk
    - first is livingsocial engineering's tech blog
      - you'll find a much more detailed post on this topic, showing code about our approach
    - the next two links are great general references on the topic of test doubles
      - the first one is a link to the pattern definition on Xunit Patterns
      - the second one is a really good article by Martin Fowler on the topic
    - and finally you can find this presentation on my GH pages
      - it's a "Remark.js" (= HTML with markdown) presentation,so you can hit "p" to see the presenter notes
